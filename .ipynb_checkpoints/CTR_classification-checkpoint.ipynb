    "# Introduction\n",
    "### Goals of project:\n",
    "Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a pivotal task in natural language understanding, aiming to ascertain if a statement logically follows from a given premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given the premise: \"He returned to the clinic three weeks later and was prescribed antibiotics\" an NLI system should deduce that the statement \"The patient has an infection\" is entailed by the premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the publication of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs). As a result, it has become increasingly challenging for clinical practitioners to keep pace with the ever-growing literature to offer personalized evidence-based care. In this context, NLI presents an opportunity to aid in the large-scale interpretation and retrieval of medical evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we propose to tackle a textual entailment task using clinical trial data. The task is based on a dataset comprising breast cancer CTRs, statements, and labels annotated by domain expert annotators. The annotated statements represent sentences that make a claim about the information within one of the sections in the CTR. The objective is to determine the inference relation (entailment vs. contradiction) between CTR-statement pairs. Additionally, we encourage the exploration of evidence-based retrieval, wherein the NLI system extracts a set of supporting facts from the premise to justify its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset : \n",
    "Dataset (https://sites.google.com/view/nli4ct/semeval-2024/get-data-and-starting-kit)\n",
    "The statements and evidence are generated by clinical domain experts, clinical trial organisers, and research oncologists from the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute and the Digital Experimental Cancer Medicine Team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description\n",
    "Each Clinical Trial Report (CTR) consists of 4 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eligibility criteria - A set of conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervention - Information concerning the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results - Number of participants in the trial, outcome measures, units, and the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adverse events - These are signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, each CTR may contain 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms. These groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics. Below is an example CTR from our dataset (see NCT02429427 for the original report)."

    "## Addressing Input Length Limitations in BERT-based Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "In this documentation, we address the challenge of input length limitations encountered when utilizing BERT models for text classification tasks. We explore various methods to overcome this constraint, focusing on the application of text and input chunking techniques. Our objective is to effectively process longer text inputs while maintaining the accuracy and performance of BERT-based classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "The limitations imposed by BERT models on input sequence length pose a significant challenge, especially when dealing with longer textual inputs. These limitations hinder the effective utilization of BERT embeddings for tasks such as text classification, where comprehensive understanding of input texts is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Solution:\n",
    "To mitigate the impact of input length restrictions, we employ text and input chunking methods. This approach involves breaking down longer text inputs into smaller chunks that fit within the maximum input length supported by BERT models. By segmenting the input text, we ensure that all relevant information is captured and processed effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text and Input Chunking:\n",
    "Utilize text and input chunking techniques to divide longer text inputs into manageable segments.\n",
    "Segment the input text based on predefined chunk sizes, ensuring that each segment conforms to the input length limitations of BERT models.\n",
    "Aggregation Strategy:\n",
    "Apply a simple averaging approach to aggregate the embedded chunks of each sample.\n",
    "Compute the average embedding vector for each chunk and combine them to represent the entire input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables the processing of longer text inputs that exceed the input length limitations of BERT models.\n",
    "Preserves the contextual information and semantic meaning of input texts by effectively capturing all relevant segments.\n",
    "Facilitates the utilization of BERT embeddings for text classification tasks, even with extensive textual inputs.\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "By adopting text and input chunking methods, we effectively address the challenges posed by input length limitations in BERT-based text classification. Our approach ensures that all pertinent information within longer text inputs is captured and processed accurately, enhancing the applicability and utility of BERT models for real-world classification tasks."

    "Evaluating Text Classification Results Using Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "In this documentation, we discuss the evaluation of text classification results using key performance metrics, including F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness and accuracy of classification models, aiding in the assessment of their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score:\n",
    "The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single value, providing a balanced measure of a model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$\n",
    "[\n",
    "F1 = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{precision} \\times \\text{recall}}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "Precision:\n",
    "Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all cases predicted as positive by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "Recall:\n",
    "Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all actual positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by displaying the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted Negative\tPredicted Positive\n",
    "Actual Negative\tTrue Negative\tFalse Positive\n",
    "Actual Positive\tFalse Negative\tTrue Positive\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "By utilizing performance metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, we can effectively evaluate the results of text classification models. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's performance, aiding in the identification of strengths and areas for improvement. Proper evaluation is essential for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of classification systems in real-world applications."

    "## Siamese Networks: Overview and Application in Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "Siamese networks are a class of neural networks designed to compare and analyze similarity between pairs of inputs. These networks learn to generate embeddings for input data in such a way that similar inputs are mapped closer together in the embedding space. In this documentation, we provide a brief explanation of Siamese networks and discuss their application in text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Siamese Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Siamese networks consist of two identical subnetworks (twins) that share the same architecture and parameters.\n",
    "Each subnetwork takes an input (or a pair of inputs) and generates a corresponding embedding vector.\n",
    "The embeddings produced by the twin subnetworks are then compared to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between the inputs.\n",
    "Application in Text Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "they can be applied to text classification tasks, including similarity detection, paraphrase identification, and authorship attribution.\n",
    "In text classification, Siamese networks learn to encode the semantic information of textual inputs into embedding vectors.\n",
    "By training the Siamese network on pairs of text inputs and their corresponding labels (e.g., similar or dissimilar), the network learns to differentiate between similar and dissimilar text pairs.\n",
    "During inference, the trained Siamese network can be used to compare new pairs of text inputs and predict their similarity or classification.\n",
    "Advantages of Siamese Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Siamese networks are capable of learning complex nonlinear relationships between inputs, making them suitable for tasks involving subtle semantic differences.\n",
    "They can effectively handle cases where labeled training data is limited, as they learn to compare inputs based on their inherent similarity rather than relying solely on labeled examples.\n",
    "Siamese networks offer flexibility in architecture and can be adapted to various types of input data and classification tasks.\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Siamese networks provide a powerful framework for text classification tasks by learning to compare and analyze similarity between pairs of text inputs. Their ability to generate meaningful embeddings and distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs makes them valuable tools for a wide range of natural language processing applications."
